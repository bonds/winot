* write tests for regex, i.e. parsing the ifconfig and routes
* delete the vpn over wlan route on cleanup

* use "route -n monitor" to detect changes to the routes, don't get a new routing table unless its changed
* notice if we're blocked by PF on wwan, wlan, vpn
* notice if we're blocked by no SSH keys in agent
* use parsec instead of regex for parsing ifconfig, routes, wlan scan, etc
* trylock before forking to conserve resources
* instead of polling everything every second, be lazier, getting routes only when needed, i.e. do less work when ping is working, do more work when its not
* use the state monad instead of World?

main
    if ping 8.8.8.8
        sleep
    else
        figure out what is wrong
        fix it
    end
    go to main

figure out what is wrong
    no vpn process
    no wlan physical connection
        no familiar network in range
        interface in a bad state, need to reboot
        incorrect password
    weak/unreliable wlan physical connection
    vpn server unpingable
    vpn server refusing ssh connections
    vpn server not sending packets back over SSH connection
    cant auth for vpn connection
        ssh auth sock file is wrong
        haven't added any good keys to ssh-agent
    no pppd process
    traffic cant get where it needs to go
        pf is blocking the traffic
        routes are not setup correctly
            vpn public via wlan private ip
            default via working gateway
    wlan if doesnt have a valid IP
        haven't asked for an IP yet
        dhcp server not responding, maybe pf is blocking?
